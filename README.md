# Batocera Control

Batocera-native Decky controls for ARM and x86 handhelds, derived from Armada Control.
This repository contains source, a prebuilt Decky frontend, the Python backend,
and a network-free installer suitable for Batocera Steam Tools.

## Why this fork exists

The former Odin 3 installer cloned Armada's moving `main` branch, overlaid an
older Batocera patch set, and ran npm on the handheld. That became
non-reproducible when upstream interfaces changed. It also allowed the plugin
to overwrite the battery LED policy and inject a Steam launch helper that did
not exist on Batocera.

Version 0.2.6 is pinned to the provenance recorded in `SOURCE.json`. It keeps
the system-owned status LED separate from the joystick rings and uses native
Batocera services for SSH and RSInput calibration.

### Rear paddles

On current Odin 3 images, the plugin discovers M1/M2 from the AYN `rsinput`
gamepad capabilities instead of opening GPIO lines directly. The Decky/FEX
backend reads those capabilities through architecture-neutral sysfs; the
native listener uses python-evdev, observes without grabbing, and reconnects
if the controller is recreated after resume. It therefore coexists with Steam,
ES, emulators, and Batocera's in-game Hotkey+paddle mappings. Older images with
the legacy `odin_backpaddles` GPIO service remain supported as a fallback.
M2 has no action on a fresh install; mouse mode remains opt-in because it
temporarily replaces normal gamepad navigation until the paddle is pressed
again.

## Install on Batocera

Extract a release and run as root:

```sh
bash install.sh
```

Decky's `PluginLoader` must already be installed (Steam Tools handles that
first). The installer verifies `PAYLOAD.sha256`, atomically replaces
`/userdata/system/homebrew/plugins/armada-control`, and never uses git, npm, or
the network. If Decky is running, it restarts it. Use `--no-restart` when
installing from an image migration or another service.

The FEX launch helper is installed at
`/userdata/system/bin/batocera-control-game-launch`. It intentionally lives
outside `/userdata/system/scripts`, because Batocera executes every file in
that directory as a game hook. The helper and FEX contract remain in userdata
if the plugin is removed so existing Steam launch options cannot become dead.

### LSFG-VK tab

The unified LSFG tab configures Batocera's system LSFG-VK integration for
Steam. It detects the native and x64/Wine layer files already supplied by the
image and requires the purchased DLL at:

```text
/userdata/system/wine/lossless-scaling/Lossless.dll
```

It does not download or bundle LSFG-VK or Lossless Scaling. Global all-games
mode applies after Steam/GamepadUI restarts. Per-game mode adds a managed,
persistent wrapper only to the selected game's Steam launch options and takes
effect on its next game launch without restarting Steam. The installer moves
an old standalone `decky-lsfg-vk` plugin to `homebrew/disabled-plugins` so only
one control tab is loaded, while retaining its config and `~/lsfg` script for
rollback. Remove the old `~/lsfg` prefix from per-game Steam launch options
before using either Batocera activation mode.

### Power, adaptive CPU/TDP, and fan control

The Power tab retains the per-profile CPU/GPU/fan-curve editor and also wraps
Batocera's native runtime controls. Qualcomm images use
`batocera-cpu-limit`, including its persistent global CPU ceiling and target
FPS. Zen3/x86 images automatically use `batocera-tdp-limit`, which adjusts
package power inside the hardware and user-selected TDP limits without taking
ownership of the normal TDP slider. Steam sessions read Gamescope statistics
while ES-launched emulators use the system's hidden FPS sampler. That sampler
is independent of Steam's visible MangoHud performance overlay.

On supported Qualcomm handhelds, the same tab exposes `qcom-fan` Automatic and
Manual modes used by Batocera Control Center. Automatic follows the system
temperature curve. Manual holds the selected 20–100% setting until Automatic
is selected again or the system restarts, and the UI warns that the curve is
temporarily overridden. Unsupported or read-only fan implementations are not
offered as writable controls.

### OLED care and screensaver

Where the Odin OLED idle-dim service is present, the OLED tab configures its
brightness cap and idle threshold. A detected Odin OLED panel also gets a
manual mostly-black moving screensaver even when the older idle-dim service is
not installed. It keeps Steam and downloads running, does not suspend or
modify saved brightness, and exits on the first controller button, keyboard
key, or touch input.

On x86 handhelds, the x64/Wine layer is sufficient. Compatibility-tool,
resolution, LED, and LSFG controls remain available, while the ARM-only FEX
controls are disabled. Existing Batocera AMD TDP/SimpleDeckyTDP controls remain
the source of the manual ceiling; adaptive TDP only moves below that ceiling
during a game session and restores the prior value when stopped.

## Develop and verify

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
npm audit
```

`dist/index.js` is committed deliberately. A Batocera target installs the
prebuilt output and does not need Node.js.

Create deterministic release archives with:

```sh
tools/make-release.sh
```

## Batocera integration

The plugin is distributed independently from the Batocera image:

1. A version tag builds and tests the frontend in GitHub Actions.
2. The workflow publishes versioned `.tar.gz` and `.zip` files plus
   `SHA256SUMS` in the GitHub release.
3. Steam Tools installs/updates Decky, downloads this artifact, verifies its
   hash, and runs `install.sh`.

The `swy8750` main branch and 8550 branch only need the release URL/update logic
in Steam Tools. No Node.js build, branch clone, or plugin Buildroot package is
needed on the target. The release is architecture-independent; hardware tabs
feature-detect the services and sysfs interfaces provided by each image.

## Persistence and removal

Plugin settings live under `/userdata/system/configs/batocera-control` (OLED
care retains its existing dedicated config directory). `uninstall.sh` removes
the Decky plugin but keeps settings and both fail-open game/LSFG launch helpers.
This is deliberate: removing a helper still referenced by Steam launch options
would make games fail to start.
